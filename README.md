# Whack-a-mole
This project is our 287 design project. Christina James and Kylie Hays worked together to complete the game whack-a-mole 
which can be played on an FPGA bored. The FPGA bored will display 4 leds in 4 desgnated holes that can be "whacked" with
4 corresponding pushbuttons. Each mole that is "whacked" rewards the player 1 point. There are 3 levels, one level with
only 1 mole, one level with 2 moles and one level with 2 moles at a faster speed. The level the player is in is indicated on 
a seven segment display by either a 1,2,3. On the same seven segment display when the player reaches a max score of 99 there 
is an F for finished.
