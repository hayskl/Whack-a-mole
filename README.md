# Whack-a-mole
Welcome to the Whack-a-mole Github! This project is our 287 design project. Christina James and Kylie Hays worked together to complete the game whack-a-mole which can be played on an DE-2 board. The DE-2 board will display 4 LEDs in 4 designated holes that can be "whacked" with 4 corresponding push buttons. Each mole that is "whacked" rewards the player 1 point. There are 3 levels, one level with only 1 mole, one level with 2 moles and one level with 2 moles at a faster speed. The level the player is in is indicated on a seven segment display by either a 1,2,3. On the same seven segment display when the player reaches a max score of 100 there is an F for finished. Furthermore, the LCD screen will prompt the player with "Begin" to start the game, "Play" while the game is running, and "Game Over!" when the player reaches the maximum score.
